# Web-scrap-flask
Did web scrapping of reviews section of any one result product searched on Flipkart. Used pre-built html page to give input about which product to search and then using python, flask, REST API and beautiful soup, the reviews section of the product being searched is scrapped and then used pre-built html page to show the results.

First install all the packages from the requirements.txt file and then run the app.py file.
Now open scrapper.log and go to end of the file, there will an IP adress starting with '192'. Copy and paste that link in your web browser and then search for a product, the results will be shown. To stop the app.py file, press Ctrl + c in the terminal window.
